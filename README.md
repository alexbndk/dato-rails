# Dato::Rails

Use [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/) in your Rails application.

This gem allows you to fetch data using Dato GraphQL APIs and render the content in your Rails app.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dato-rails', require: 'dato'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dato-rails

The gem is made of two parts:

## GraphQL client

The GraphQL client based on [GQLi](https://github.com/contentful-labs/gqli.rb) allows to perform 
queries to the GraphQL endpoint.
Look at GQLi documentation for more information about the syntax of queries.
You can also find some examples in specs of this library.

Set your api token as `DATO_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

```ruby
client = Dato::Client.new # you can also pass the api token here.
query = GQLi::DSL.query {
  homepage {
    id
  }
}
response = client.execute(query)

puts response.data.homepage.id
```

We provide a fragment to extract a Responsive Image.

```ruby
GQLi::DSL.query {
  homepage {
    id
    content {
      value
      blocks {
        __typename
        id
        image {
          responsiveImage(imgixParams: {fm: __enum("png")}) {
            ___ Dato::Fragments::ResponsiveImage
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## View rendering

The library is also a Rails Engine and provides a whole set of ViewComponents to render your content.
The lirbary aims to provide the most basic components and make it easy to create new one.

Once you fetched the response of a query, you can use the Dato ViewComponents to render the content.

If you have a StructuredText component, you can render it with:

```ruby
render Dato::StructuredText.new(response.data.homepage.content)
```

If you have a responsive image, you can render it with:

```ruby
render Dato::ResponsiveImage.new(node.image.responsiveImage)
```

To define a custom node, you can create a new `Dato::CustomNode` view component in your application and it will be automatically used.

You can also customize how each node type is rendered by specifying the mapping on the single render:

```ruby
render Dato::StructuredText.new(response.data.homepage.content, overrides: { link: Dato::NotRendered })
```

or globally:

```
# config/initializers/dato.rb

Dato::Config.overrides = {
  link: 'Dato::NotRendered'
}.with_indifferent_access
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 

You can now clone the dato-rails project

[![Clone DatoCMS project](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone?projectId=57262&name=dato-rails
)


You then need to set a `DATO_API_TOKEN=abcd123x` in the `.env` file on the root of your project
to consume data from your project.

Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. 

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, 
which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, 
and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
